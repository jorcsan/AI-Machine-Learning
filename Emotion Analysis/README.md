## Image Analysis

The goal of this project is to create a model that can correctly predict if an image is portraying the emotions "happy" or "sad."
The model that I created is a Convolutional Neural Network. The images used our resized to a 256 by 256 format to make sure they all owrk correctly with our model. The datset 
was pulled from an existing github repo. However all of the images can be sourced using google.

Frameworks: Tensorflow, numpy, openCV, and matplotlib
